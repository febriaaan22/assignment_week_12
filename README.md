# WEEK 12 


## INTRODUCTION

Hi, i’m Ireng Febrian Sanjaya and this is my assignment for week 12. Through out the whole process on the making of this project, I apply alot of my past project insight into this one. Every mistake that I’ve been through, I could solve it easily at this point because my past project teach me alot of things. This week I learn frontend in Typescript and I didn’t get used to copying code from Ant Design, so it takes a lot of time. I need to learn more about using Formik, Ant Design, and Yup for validation at the same time and for beginner like me the logic for not messing it up is needed. I’m still learning using useState, and the part that I’m still proud the most: I could learn to debugging my failed deployment and it work.

## TOOLS

- Ant Design: CSS framework
- Formik & Yup: Validation
